        If you have previously downloaded a backup, and it has been since been deleted,
        you can use the manual backup feature to put it back in the restore list
        so it can be used. You must upload it (via FTP or another method) to your
        /includes/files/ directory, and then enter the name of the file below once
        you have uploaded it.
        Example: backup_10.xml

    <manual_file_req>You must enter the filename, please go back and correct this.</manual_file_req>
    <manual_file_miss>The filename you entered does not exist or is not writable, please correct this and try again.</manual_file_miss>
